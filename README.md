**Problems from Videos**

fcm token to send notification to specific device.

  App sending data but it stops when close or minimize.

Answer: Creating a background task will do the job. There is a package for this work manager.

Answer: You can try to take the difference between DateTime now with your birthday in seconds and
add it to the duration.

- Question: I create static onActionReceived() method and call it in setListeners for receiving
  payload. But when I hot reload my app it say Invalid global or static function to receive
  notification on background.

- Question: The method 'setListeners' isn't defined for the type 'AwesomeNotifications'.
  Try correcting the name to the name of an existing method, or defining a method named '
  setListeners'.

- Question: Can it possible that notification get pop out rather than to scroll it to view?

Answer: Set `importance: NotificationImportance.Max,` of initialization of NotificationChannel.
